<div align="left" style="width:500px;">
<h1>Posts</h1>
<p>A post represents a single file that's been uploaded. Each post can have several <a href="/help/tags">tags</a> and <a href="/help/comments">comments</a>. If you have an <a href="/help/accounts">account</a>, you can also add a post to your <a href="/help/favorites">favorites</a>.</p>

<h4>Search</h4>
<p>Searching for posts is straightforward. Simply enter the tags you want to search for, separated by spaces. For example, searching for <code>original panties</code> will return every post that has both the original tag <strong>and</strong> the panties tag.</p>

<h4>Tag List</h4>
<p>In both the listing page and the show page you'll notice a list of tag links with characters next to them. Here's an explanation of what the links are:</p>

<h6>?</h6>
<p>This links to the wiki page for the tag. If the tag is an <a href="/help/artists">artist</a> type, then you'll be redirected to the artist page.</p>
      
<h6>A</h6>
<p>This adds the tag to the current search.</p>

<h6>S</h6>
<p>This adds the negated tag to the current search.</p>

<h6>R</h6>
<p>This remove the tag from the current search.</p>
            
<h6>700</h6>
<p>The number next to the tag represents how many posts there are. This isn't always the total number of posts for that tag. If you're searching for a combination of tags, this will be the number of posts that have the tag AND the current tag query. If you're not searching for anything, this will be the number of posts found.</p>
      
<h6>Color</h6>
<p>Some tag links may be colored green, purple, red, or blue. Green means the tag represents a character. Purple means the tag represents a copyright (things like anime, manga, games, or novels). Red means the tag represents an artist. And blue represents a generic tag.</p>

<p>When you're not searching for a tag, by default the tag list will show the most popular tags. When you are searching for tags, the tag list will show related tags.</p>
