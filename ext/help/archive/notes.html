<div align="left" style="width:500px;">
<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>You can annotate images with notes. This is primarily used to translate text. Please do not use a note when a comment would suffice.</p>
<br />
<p>If you have an issue with an existing note or have a comment about it, instead of replacing the note, post a comment. Comments are more visible to other users, and chances are someone will respond to your inquiry.</p>
<br />
<p>You can create a new note via the <b>Add Note</b> button in the sidebar. The note will appear over the image. You can drag this note inside the image. You can resize the note by dragging any side or corner of the note.</p>
<br />
<p>This box will also contain four links:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Save</b> This saves the note to the database.</li>
    <li><b>Cancel</b> This reverts the note to the last saved copy. The note position, dimensions, and text will all be restored.</li>
    <li><b>Remove</b> This doesn't actually remove the note from the database; it only hides it from view. You can undelete a note by reverting to a previous version.</li>
</ul>
