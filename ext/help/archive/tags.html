<h1>Tags</h1>
<p>Tags are basically keywords you can use to describe <a href="/help/posts">posts</a>, allowing you to easily search and explore posts based on their content. Consult the <a href="/help/cheatsheet">cheat sheet</a> for a full list of what you can search on.</p>

<h4>Guidelines</h4>
<p>When you're tagging a post, use the following guidelines:</p>
    
<h6>Replace spaces with underscores</h6>
<p>For example, <code>maria-sama ga miteru</code> becomes <code>maria-sama_ga_miteru</code>. This small concession makes other features much easier to implement.</p>

<h6>Forbidden characters</h6>
<p>The following characters are stripped from tags: commas and semicolons.</p>

<h4>Types</h4>
<p>Tags can be typed. Currently there are only three types: artist, character, and copyright.</p>

<h6>General</h6>
<p>When tagging something, you can tell system that a tag is an artist, a character or a copyright tag by prefixing it.</p>
<p>the general prefix resets a previous tag. For example if the tag <code>car</code> is categorized as artist you can set <code>general:car</code> and it will be reseted.</p>
    
<h6>Artist</h6>
<p>Artist tags identify the tag as the artist. This doesn't mean the artist of the original copyrighted artwork (for example, you wouldn't use the <code>barasui</code> tag on a picture of Miu drawn by <code>hanaharu_naruko</code>).</p>
<p>For example, tagging something <code>artist:mark tree</code> will tag a post with <code>mark</code> and <code>tree</code>. If the <code>mark</code> tag doesn't already exist, it'll be created with the tag type set to artist.</p>
 
<h6>Character</h6>
<p>Character tags identify the tag as a character. They work exactly like artist tags, only you prefix with "character".</p>
      
<h6>Copyright</h6>
<p>The copyright type indicates the tag represents an anime, a game, a novel, or some sort of copyrighted setting. Otherwise they work identically to character and artist tags, only you prefix with "copyright" instead.</p>
