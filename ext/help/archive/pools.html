<h1>Pools</h1>
<p>Pools are groups of posts with a common theme. They are similar to <a href="/help/favorites">favorites</a>  with three important differences: public pools allow anyone to add or remove from them, you can create multiple pools, and posts in a pool can be ordered. This makes pools ideal for subjective tags, or for posts that are part of a series (as is the case in manga).</p>
<br />
<p>Pools can be private or public. A private pool means you are the only person who can add or remove from it (the owner). In contrast, public pools can be updated by anyone.</p>
<br />
<p>If you're importing several posts into a pool, you must use the <b>Import</b> button. Insert the tags in the box at the top in the sidebar and the ckicn on <b>Import</b>. This should return a list of posts witch sheckboxes to select the posts you want to add to the current pool.</p>
<br />
<p>To remove a post from a pool, go to the pool's page and click the button <b>Edit Pool</b>. Then click on the checkboxes of the posts you want to delete.</p>
