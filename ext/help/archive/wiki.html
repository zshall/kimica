<h4>Style Guideline</h4>

<p>The wiki has no specific style guide, but here's some general advice for creating wiki pages for tags:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use h4 for all headers, h6 for subheaders.</li>
    <li>Bundle any relevant links at the end under a See also section.</li>
    <li>For artists, include the artist's home page under the See also section</li>
</ul>
